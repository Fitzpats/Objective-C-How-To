Objective C- Hello World! 

  Objective C is most easily installed on the Mac OS, but it can also be installed on Windows or Linux. I personally installed it 
on my Macbook (named Georgiana), and it was very simple. For Mac OS, all you need to do is go into the app store, and install Xcode 
though it can also be downloaded at this link: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ I'm sure there are other ways to do this, but this was 
the easiest way for me. I used Xcode to then write my code by opening a new command line tool project in Objective C, and then just codeing
into the main.m file that is automatically created. You can run the programs you write by just clicking the play button in the top lefthand
corner. from what i can tell, the boiler plate code in Objective C is:


#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) 

and comments are written with two forward slashes before the text.

#Data types and naming conventions for Objctive C

  When naming variables in Objective C you should take the following rules into mind: They have to begin with a letter(upper or lover case)
or underscore, and they can be followed by any combination of letters (upper or lower case), digits, or underscores. There are reserved 
words that you can not use as the name of a variable (such as int) and spaces and special characters can not be used in variable names. 
The variable names in Objetive C are also upper and lover case letter distinct, which means that **cat** , **Cat** , and **CAT** could all be different 
variable names. In the Objective C programing community the convention is to seperate words in the variables by useing camel case so insteas of a variable 
being named **toebeans** it would be names **toeBeans**

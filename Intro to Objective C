Objective C

  Objective C was created by Tom Love and Brad Cox at Stepstone in the early 80's. It was invented to add Smalltalk's capabilities to C,
  and created an object oriented extention to C. It is a compiled programing language, and it uses virtual machines. Objective C is used 
  when writing software for iOS and OS X and can be used to write apps. 

  The top three projects on GitHub using Objective C are: 
  This collection of Xcode snippets https://github.com/Xcode-Snippets/Objective-C
  PubNub (a datastrean network)  https://github.com/pubnub/objective-c
  The Official NY Times Style Guide https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide
  
  When the time comes i'm planning on using the book Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide In addition to videos and 
  web scources as necessary.
